# Design

The user starts at the index page, where they can either register an account, or login.
Upon logging in, the user is greeted with their dashboard which lists all their current tasks (showing who it was created by, the title of the task, time spent on it, and whether or not it is completed). They can select tasks to edit, or create new tasks. The user can then logout.

# Tasktracker

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
